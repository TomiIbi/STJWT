<div class="content">
	Saint Joan’s Womens Trust was developed as part of an initiative to change the narrative for women in the place of work. 
We believe that giving the gift of self-reliance through empowerment is a silver bullet to systemic change.
Our focus is on Changing the Narrative," for example, although the financial services industry is commonly referred to as an "old boys club", we have been able to highlight incredible women who are totally crushing it and paving the way in financial services. Financial literacy is the ability to understand how money works. Our aim is to teach you, amongst other things, information about various finance principles through entertaining stories and introduce you to new ideas and perspectives on life.
